This is the repository for my zuri songcrud music project. The project was done in a virtual environment called "djenv" and the project called "songcrud". The name of the app is "musicapp". I intentionally uploaded the virtual environment folder. More updates coming...

#NOTICE: Please I have been seeking assistance from zuri team but no response so far as Twitter is the only means available. I even sent countless emails but no answer.  I did a project that contained two different tasks. So after doing one, I mistakenly submitted the link. Before I could finish the second task within few hours, the tasks were graded and I got 2.5 out of the 6, without the second  being graded since it wasn't yet done by me. Now, this task was 5 days away from deadline and today 3 days away and I never believed it would be graded before the deadline.

Please all I need is a re-grade and I can't find a way to get it. Help me out on this or direct me to the right channel. Thank you. I will be deleting this after this task is graded
